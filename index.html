    <title>Elias Rubin | Student at Princeton University</title>

    </head>

    <body>
    <h3>My name is Elias Rubin </h3>
    <p> I am a junior at Princeton University where I study astrophysics and computer science.
    </p>
    <p>My current research is at the intersection of computing and astrophysics -- specifically using deep learning to improve data fidelity from the prime-focus spectrograph.  Previously I worked on high-performance massively parallel radiation hydrodynamics models of star formation in galactic disks. </p>

    <p> I'm spending the summer at the Atacama Large Millimeter Array Telescope in Chile as a software engineering intern, but I might be interested in an internship for the fall of this year or talking about full-time positions after graduation. If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach me via <a href="mailto:erubin@princeton.edu"> email. </a> </p>
