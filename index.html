    <h2> Welcome! </h2>
    <p>
    I'm Elias Rubin and I'm a junior at Princeton University studying Astrophysics. My academic interests include large-scale simulations, parallel computing, image processing, and machine learning. Outside of class I am a leader and technical skills trainer for the Princeton University Outdoor Action Program, writing director of Sans Comic Sketch Comedy, and a member of Cloister Inn. I play the bass guitar and enjoy skiing and cycling.
