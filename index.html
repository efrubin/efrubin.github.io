<div class = "box">
    <p> <strong class='label'> currently:</strong> I am currently taking a semester off from Princeton to intern at Google in Cambridge, MA. I'm working on Firebase â€“ a suite of cloud services for mobile application developers.</p>

    <p> <strong class='label'> previously:</strong> I recently completed a summer spent as a research associate at the Atacama Large Millimeter Array Telescope in Chile.  I developed a tool to assist scientists in automatic image processing, and also investigated the possibility of star formation at the centers of active galactic nuclei. At Princeton, my <a href="assets/docs/SpringJP.pdf" class="jp"> spring junior paper</a> focused on using deep autoencoders to learn from undersampled spectrograph data.  My <a href="assets/docs/FallJP.pdf" class="jp"> fall junior paper </a> examined radiation dynamics in giant molecular clouds and galactic disks through massively parallel simulations. </p>

    <p> <strong class="label"> next:</strong> I'll be returning to Princeton in the spring and plan to finish my coursework and senior thesis by January 2018. I'm happy to chat about internship opportunities for summer 2017, or full-time opportunities for after graduation. </p>

    <p> <strong class="label"> interests:</strong> Outside of the classroom, I'm involved with Princeton's outdoor program.  I'm a big fan of hiking, backpacking, cycling, and skiing.  I also enjoy learning about new technologies and always like a good book. </p>
