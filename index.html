    <h3>Elias Rubin </h3>
<div class = "box">
    <p> <strong class='label'> currently:</strong> I'm at Princeton until the end of January 2018, where I'm finishing up my senior thesis research on the formation of black holes in the early universe.</p>

    <p> <strong class='label'> previously:</strong> This past summer I worked at Google as a software engineering intern on the Cloud Dataflow team in Seattle. Last fall I interned on the Firebase team in Cambridge, and before that I worked at the Atacama Large Millimeter Array Telescope in Chile and at Princeton as a research associate with the astrophysics department.

    <p> <strong class="label"> next:</strong> In March, I'll be joining a small proprietary trading firm in New York as a full-time software developer.</p>

    <p> <strong class="label"> interests:</strong> Outside of the classroom, I'm involved with Princeton's outdoor program. I'm a big fan of hiking, backpacking, cycling, and skiing. I also enjoy learning about new technologies and always like a good book. </p>
