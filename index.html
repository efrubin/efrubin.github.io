    <h3>Elias Rubin </h3>
<div class = "box">
    <p> <strong class='label'> currently:</strong> I am currently working as a research associate at the Atacama Large Millimeter Array Telescope in Chile.  My science research is focused on star formation at the centers of active galactic nuclei, and my technical work is focused on improving ALMA's automatic image processing pipeline. </p>

    <p> <strong class='label'> previously:</strong> I just finished my junior year at Princeton University, where I am studying astrophysics and computer science. My <a href="assets/docs/SpringJP.pdf" class="jp"> spring junior paper </a> focused on using deep autoencoders to learn from undersampled spectrograph data.  My <a href="assets/docs/FallJP.pdf" class="jp"> fall junior paper </a> examined radiation dynamics in giant molecular clouds and galactic disks through massively parallel simulations. </p>

    <p> <strong class="label"> next:</strong> I'm taking the year off from Princeton to gain experience working in the tech industry.  I'll be spending the fall interning at Google in their Cambridge, MA offices.  After that, I'm not quite sure. I'd love to chat about interesting internship opportunities for the spring or summer of 2017. </p>

    <p> <strong class="label"> interests:</strong> Outside of the classroom, I'm involved with Princeton's outdoor program.  I'm a big fan of hiking, backpacking, cycling, and skiing.  I also enjoy learning about new technologies and always like a good book. </p>
