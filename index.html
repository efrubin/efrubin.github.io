    <h3>Elias Rubin </h3>
<div class = "box">
    <p> <strong class='label'> currently:</strong> I work as a software developer at <a href="https://www.fiverings.com">Five Rings</a>, a propriety trading firm in NYC. These days I mostly work on automated trading strategies, but over the years projects have included order routing bridges, pricing engines, and supplementary data processing applications.  </p>

    <p> <strong class='label'> previously:</strong> I studied astrophysics at Princeton University. During college I worked at Google as a software engineering intern on the Cloud Dataflow team in Seattle and on the Firebase team in Cambridge. I also spent a summer working at the Atacama Large Millimeter Array Telescope in Chile.</p>

    <p> <strong class='label'> interests:</strong> Outside of work I enjoy travel and photography (most recently to Greenland) as well as running, hiking, cycling, and skiing.</p>
